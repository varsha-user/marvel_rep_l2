# TASK 1: Linear and logistic regression
I learnt about the fundamentals of linear and logistic regression.
For linear regression, I did a house price prediction model using the Califronia housing dataset available on Google colab.
For Logistic regression, I did a a simply flower classifying model, using the iris dataset.

# TASK 2: Matplotlib and Data Visualisation
I understood the usage of matplotlib and the different ways for visualising data:

# TASK 3: Numpy
This was an easy task, where we had to use numpy funtions to do perform this: Generate an array by repeating a small array across each dimension and generate an array with element indexes such that the array elements appear in ascending order.

# TASK 4: Metrics and Performance Evaluation
I studied the different metrics used to evaluate how good and efficiently a model is performing. I included the implementation of this in the first task's two models itself, same colab file, so same link.

# TASK 5: Linear and Logistic Regression - Coding the model from SCRATCH
I studied all the maths and the concepts behind both logistic and linear regression. In both the cases, I have used my own custom datasets. Honestly, I think the mdoels that i made can be improved a lot, because the accuracy was far below my expectation and the error was huge. I'll try working on it again.

# TASK 6: 



# TASK 8: Mathematics behind machine learning
I learnt about curve fitting, which is an ML process to find the best fitting curve or function, in order to least error. 
And I also learnt how the best fit line is chosen via the least squared method, along with the maths.

About the fourier transfrom, I now know that it is used in various real life use cases, like sound engineering, image recognition and analysis, quantum mechanics, etc.
So, any complex signal or wave, could be broken down to simpler multiple sine and cos waves. This is with the help of the fourier transforms, where say we give an amplitude vs time graph to get a broken down graph of amplitude vs frequency.

I generated a simple sine wave in time domain in MATLAB, and then converted it to its frequency components, using fourier transform.
